      -Step1: first we take our oil and put it in a bowl and heat it up in low heat.
                
      -Step2: then put the corn and salt into the oil and close the lid and rise the flame to medium heat till it starts popping.

      -Step3: putting that aside we take a diffrent bowl and put our sugar in there.

      -Step4: then we heat the sugar in medium flame and caramelize the sugar (note: it will take a while).

      -Step5: once the sugar is caramelized and the corn is popped we take the caramelized sugar and pour it on the popped corn
